Please run the `setup.ipynb` notebook **before the first class**. If you don't, you will waste precious time during the class.

You need to install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt` and the [graphviz library](https://www.graphviz.org/download/)

To make this safe:

Run this in prior for each lap to work with each lap enviroments:
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
